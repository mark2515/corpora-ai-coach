# Corpus AI Coach
Corpus AI Coach aims to addresses the challenge of unnatural and unconfident spoken English among non-native speakers. Many learners struggle with fluency and confidence due to limited opportunities to engage in authentic conversations with native speakers. This often makes them avoid speaking, which slows down their language learning. A key underlying issue is the lack of structured vocabulary acquisition focused on high-frequency words used in everyday contexts. Without guidance, learners often spend time on less relevant vocabulary, reducing learning efficiency and motivation. Polysemy and phrasal verbs present additional difficulties, as meaning often depends on context.

To tackle this, we leverage GPT and evidence-based word frequency lists (e.g., BNC/COCA) to prioritize learning of the most common spoken English words. Users can engage in role-play conversations with an AI partner, set personalized goals such as mastering the top 6,500 words, and track their progress visually. The system highlights high-frequency vocabulary while filtering out less common terms, allowing learners to focus on what matters most and build confidence in real-world communication.
